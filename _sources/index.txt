Lorenzo Stella
==============

I am a Ph.D. student at `IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca`_ (Italy) and `KU
Leuven`_ (Belgium), where I work under the supervision of `Panagiotis Patrinos`_
and `Alberto Bemporad`_. My research interests are in the field of nonsmooth
optimization.

I obtained my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Florence,
where I graduated in 2011 under the supervision of `Luigi Brugnano`_.

**I'm on the job market!**
