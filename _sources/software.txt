(more in my `Github profile`_)

★ `ForBES`_. Generic and efficient MATLAB solver for nonsmooth optimization
problems. The solver is provided with a library of mathematical functions used
in applications, along with their gradient and proximal operations.

★ `libForBES`_. Framework in C++ for modeling and solving large-scale nonsmooth
optimization problems. It will allow to interface many high-level languages
(including MATLAB, R, Python, Julia) to a unique solver capable of addressing
nonsmooth optimization problems from several application fields.
