Software projects
=================

(more in my `Github profile`_)

★ `ForBES`_. Generic and efficient MATLAB solver for nonsmooth optimization
problems. The solver is provided with a library of mathematical functions used
in applications, along with their gradient and proximal operations.

★ `libForBES`_. Framework in C++ for modeling and solving large-scale nonsmooth
optimization problems. It will allow to interface many high-level languages
(including MATLAB, R, Python, Julia) to a unique solver capable of addressing
nonsmooth optimization problems from several application fields.

★ `libLBFGS`_. Library written in C containing the structures and routines
necessary for computing search directions in the limited-memory BFGS algorithm
(L-BFGS), for large-scale smooth unconstrained optimization. Contains a Mex
interface to MATLAB.

**Just for fun**

★ `Matto`_. A simple chess player implemented in C. I started this when I was 17
and learning the C programming language, so there's a lot of room for
improvement. Yet it plays in a meaningful way.
