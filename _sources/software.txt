Software projects
=================

(more in my `Github profile`_)

★ `ForBES`_. MATLAB solver for nonsmooth optimization, contains a library of
mathematical functions to formulate problems arising in control, machine
learning, image and signal processing.

★ `libForBES`_. C++ framework for modeling and solving large-scale nonsmooth
optimization problems, will allow to interface many high-level languages
(including R, Python, Julia) to a unique solver capable of addressing nonsmooth
optimization problems from several application fields.

★ `libLBFGS`_. C library providing the structures and routines to implement the
limited-memory BFGS algorithm (L-BFGS) for large-scale smooth unconstrained
optimization. Contains a Mex interface to MATLAB.

**Just for fun**

★ `Matto`_. A simple chess player implemented in C. I started this when I was 17
and learning the C programming language, so there's a lot of room for
improvement. Yet it plays in a meaningful way.
