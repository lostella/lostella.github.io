Hello! I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon in Berlin.
Previously I was Ph.D. student at [IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca](http://www.imtlucca.it/) (Italy)
and [KU Leuven](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/) (Belgium), under the supervision of
[Panos Patrinos](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/person.php?persid=639&id=782)
and [Alberto Bemporad](http://cse.lab.imtlucca.it/~bemporad/),
where I did research on algorithms for large-scale nonsmooth optimization problems,
their theoretical analysis and efficient implementation.

Check out my [recent publications]({{ "/research" }}), [software projects]({{ "/software" }}), and [blog posts]({{ "/blog" }}), or find more about me in my <a href="{{ site.author.cv }}" target="_blank">curriculum vitae</a> and feel free to [contact me](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).
