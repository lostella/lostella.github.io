# Hello!

I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon, Berlin (Germany).
Previously I was Ph.D. student at [IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca](http://www.imtlucca.it/) (Italy)
and [KU Leuven](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/) (Belgium), under the supervision of
[Panos Patrinos](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/person.php?persid=639&id=782)
and [Alberto Bemporad](http://cse.lab.imtlucca.it/~bemporad/),
where I did research on algorithms for large-scale nonsmooth optimization problems,
their theoretical analysis and efficient implementation.

Check out my [recent publications]({{ "/research" }}) and [software projects]({{ "/software" }}), or find more about me in my [curriculum vitae]({{ site.author.cv }}) and feel free to [contact me](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).
