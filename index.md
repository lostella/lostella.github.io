# Hello!

I'm a Ph.D. student at [IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca](http://www.imtlucca.it/) (Italy)
and [KU Leuven](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/) (Belgium), under the supervision of
[Panos Patrinos](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/person.php?persid=639&id=782)
and [Alberto Bemporad](http://cse.lab.imtlucca.it/~bemporad/).
My research interests cover algorithms for large-scale nonsmooth optimization problems,
their theoretical analysis and efficient implementation.

Check out my [recent publications]({{ "/research" }}) and my [software projects]({{ "/software" }}).

### I'm on the job market!

Find more about me in my [curriculum vitae]({{ site.author.cv }}), and feel free to [contact me](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}).
