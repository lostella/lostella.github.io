Hello! I'm Lorenzo, a computer scientist currently working at AWS in Berlin.

Previously I was Ph.D. student at [IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca](http://www.imtlucca.it/) (Italy)
and [KU Leuven](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/) (Belgium), under the supervision of
[Panos Patrinos](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/person.php?persid=639&id=782)
and [Alberto Bemporad](http://cse.lab.imtlucca.it/~bemporad/),
where I did research on algorithms for large-scale nonsmooth optimization problems,
their theoretical analysis and efficient implementation.

Check out my [recent publications]({{< ref "research" >}}), [projects]({{< ref "projects" >}}),
and [blog posts]({{< ref "blog" >}}).
